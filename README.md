# POMODORO TIMER

In this project, I used Vite to start the aplication with React + TypeScript.

The figma to construct the layout was:

- [pomodoro-timer](<https://www.figma.com/file/h1LId44vl4Av8DLgn3knJF/Ignite-Timer-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=8S1uEsgSAPOM4Xvs-0>)

## In this project I learn:

- How to style React components using the library _STYLED-COMPONENTS_.
- How to managed pages using _REACT ROUTER DOM_ to the clock page and the history page.
- how to transmit component information for use in different places in the application through the _REACT CONTEXT API_.
- Use _REDUCERS_, for formatting and use when working with multiple and more complex information.
- Form validations through _ZOD_, as well as with _react-hook-form-resolvers_.
